{What qualities are required to become a renowned blitz expert? Are there any
special techniques for increasing your performance in rapid and blitz events?
Do you need to develop particular skills or it is sufficient to just play
fast? Those questions became more topical these days due to the lockdown, when
all live events were cancelled and the only way to compete in tournaments was
to play online. Usually, the time control of such online tournaments are 3'
+2" or 5'+ 3", and only in some very rare cases 10' + 2'' or 15 + 5", which
almost feels like classical time control. My article is about improving one's
blitz skills, and what I have in mind is mainly the first two, which are
widely accepted as the regular blitz time controls. In my article, I will show
you a couple of advanced blitz techniques, used by the greatest players of our
time - Carlsen, Nakamura, Nepo, MVL, Mamedyarov, and also by many other blitz
experts. My goal is to teach you how to make use of these techniques in your
own games, which will certainly help you improve your blitz performance. I
would also like to share with you some of the blitz techniques I learned in my
30 years of competitive practice. I am sure that you will have a lot of fun
solving the large puzzle section and studying the special part about the fight
for domination and bluff in the games of the Top 10 blitz players. I started
to play chess in the 1980s, long before computers took authority in chess. The
only way to quickly improve our chess was to play countless friendly blitz
games. There were no rapid or blitz events at that time, and our coaches often
criticized us, arguing that this type of chess was useless and could only harm
our serious chess development. Since then I participated in very few rapid and
blitz events, mostly during the open tournament chains I played in Spain,
France or Italy. I had never prepared especially for those blitz events and I
played the same way as I play classical chess. Without using any special
techniques, naturally, my results were quite unstable. Often I lost in the
last rounds against the tournament leaders who were confidently outplaying me,
even sometimes from completely lost positions. I never accepted those defeats
seriously, as I have always been a classical player, with the classical view
that the main purpose of playing blitz is to have fun. But in 2018 I decided
to take part in my first serious blitz (and rapid) event - the European
Championship in Skopie. I arrived the day before and decided to take a look at
the top streamers, Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura. Within about three
hours I was able to learn a lot, for instance how to save time by quickly
passing the ball to the opponent without making changes. While looking at the
games of Carlsen and Nakamura I came to the (wrong) conclusion that to be
successful at blitz, you just need to make fast and flexible decisions, aiming
to keep the game on the rational track and generally avoiding lines with
unclear consequences. I finished in the top 25 in both blitz and rapid events
and I was happy, taking into account that I had never taken that format very
seriously before. But this was only my first step towards revealing the
secrets of blitz mastery. In the first half of 2020, I made a thorough
research, deeply analysing more than 2000 blitz games between players from the
Top 10. The first basic difference I found between their blitz and classical
chess was that the top players evaluate the positions somewhat differently. I
realized that in blitz, some factors have a much higher priority. To
illustrate my point, I will start with the following example. The position is
from the blitz game Karjakin - Carlsen 2019, Cote De Ivoire, chess24 blitz
event. Let us first evaluate the position the classical way: White has a safer
king but the worse pawn structure - he has two weak pawns on a2 and d4. Black
has the better minor piece, as the pawns are on both wings, and he has chances
to create a distant passed pawn on the queenside. In classical chess, the
position should be about equal, but it is only black who can fight for a win.
So what is the blitz evaluation? Is it any different? The amazing thing is
that the evaluation of the position in blitz will show White as the clear
favourite. He has better chances, as he can freely organize pressure against
the opponent's king, using the open e-file or advancing his h-pawn to h6.
Another very important advantage is the combination of queen and knight, which
is generally strong, and especially in blitz. Even Carlsen, who is arguably
the best blitz player of our time and a very strong defender, finally had to
succumb to the pressure.} 30... Rc7 $1 {Protecting the vulnerable points is
the top priority of the side that has issues with king safety.} 31. a4 Qd5 $1
32. Re4 $1 {Preparing to take control of the open file.} Rf7 $1 33. h4 $1 {
h4-h5-h6 is a very common tool to trouble the black king.} Bc7 {The first

winning chances.} 36. Kg1 $1 {Releasing the beast.} b5 37. axb5 axb5 {The
passed pawn is quite a valuable trump card in black's hand.} 38. Rd8 $1 Qc6 {
It was the most intuitive solution for Black to escape from the pin. But at
the same time, it was the decisive mistake, as it releases the passed pawn.
Already Black had to find the only move,} (38... Rf8 $1 {, when most probably
after} 39. Rd7+ Rf7 {, White had nothing more than a draw.}) ({Of course not} 
38... Re7 $4 39. Qxe7+) 39. h5 $1 $18 {, and the game is over. Black's king
falls into a mating net.} Bf8 (39... Re7 40. h6+ Kf7 41. Qb3+ Qc4 42. Qxc4+
bxc4 43. Rxd6 $18) 40. d5 $1 {This move would have won instantly. In the game,

Qc7 41. Nd4 $18 {With a decisive attack for White. What happened? How could
Black end up losing after defending so carefully? Was it only because he
blundered in a good position? Let me reveal the first secret, shared by all
blitz experts: The side who has the safer king usually enjoys the advantage,
no matter what else is happening on the board. The explanation is quite
logical: The attacker can increase the pressure by natural and risk-free moves,
while the side with the more vulnerable king is often obliged to find a series
of accurate and often only moves. In blitz, time is a very limited resource,
therefore having an advantage on the clock is of primary importance. The
attacker's play is more natural, therefore he can make his moves faster -
accumulating an advantage on the clock. This may sound like nothing special,
but it leads to a second, crucial point. The side which has the initiative and
pressure against the opponent's king can more often than not play faster while
risking less. At this point I would like to introduce the first blitz
technique of this article, which I call domination. Generally, this term is
used when active pieces have a stranglehold over passive pieces. But in the
context of this article, I will use it to describe something different: The
psychological advantage that the player with the initiative has in blitz, as
he is in a better position to gain an advantage on the clock and provoke
mistakes by his opponent. It is noticeable that in the games between the
world's best blitz players, the struggle for this psychological domination is
a always a very central theme. Let me show you two more examples on this topic.

{Black's bishop pair might give him an advantage, as well as his nice central
pawns and the possibility to create an outpost on e5. It might offer him good
winning chances in classical chess, but you will quickly realise that playing
this position in blitz is equal to suicide. The complete lack of fast
counterplay and the numerous issues with his rather vulnerable king's position,
as well as the defence of the weak pawns on f6 and e6, make black's position
hopeless. Just watch how fast it crumbles without any special efforts from the
white side.} 16. Ne2 Qc5 (16... d5 17. exd5 Bxd5 18. Nf4 $1 {is awkward to

king, the first step is to stop the opponent's counterplay. Then, if you avoid
exchanges and continuously improve your pieces while repeatedly creating small
threats, you will inevitably accumulate an advantage on the clock. Your
opponent is obliged to carefully follow your actions and precisely calculate
possible tricks. Usually, the defender is doomed, unless he manages to create
counterplay or beat off the attack, for example by forcing exchanges. Due to
the limited time to think, the defender is unlikely to find an ingenious way
to change the flow of the game. If the defender attempts to solve the problems
he has, he risks to end up with nothing valuable, and his time will be gone
forever!} 1-0

{In classical chess, this position should be clearly in White's favour, who
has the better pieces and a space advantage. Black's only concrete idea is to
play d6-d5, but for the moment White has this under lock and key. But let's
speak about the blitz evaluation. I think you can guess that since Black has a
much safer king, he has the advantage. It is not a surprise that in only a few
moves, his advantage gets quite sizeable.} 20... h5 $1 {The time has come for

at those examples from the games between such heavyweight fighters, it becomes
clear how decisive the factor of king safety is at blitz. Of course, this
knowledge strongly affects the decision-making process. Taking into account
what you have just learned, you can easily steer the game in the direction you
need to be the active side. In blitz, the attacker has one significant
advantage: It is much easier to play attack than defence. If you make a
mistake while attacking, the game usually continues, but one small error in
defence often proves fatal. Therefore, the attacking side inevitably
accumulates an advantage on the clock, which is often no less important than
the objective evaluation of the position. I will offer you a small challenge
now. Please evaluate the following ten positions with regard to the time
control being blitz.} *

{The right answer is that Black is winning. While Black does have a more
exposed king, due to the isolated position of White's queen on a2 this is

{I don't want to be in White's shoes in this position. Black has long-term
compensation for the material disadvantage because of his much safer king. He
has a nice central passed pawn, his knights are very jumpy, while at the same
time White's pieces are rather uncoordinated. It is not the ideal position to
play at blitz, as White carries a high responsibility for his moves, while
Black's play is quite straightforward. It is not a surprise that Caruana
disintegrated in just a few moves. Mamedyarov is definitely an unpleasant
opponent as he is a great master at such messy positions.} 32. Qe2 (32. Qh1 {

{After analysing many of Carlsen's blitz games, I realized how he imposes his
will on his opponents. Now I will present four of his games and explain how he
employs the domination technique to exert psychological pressure and provoke
mistakes. Magnus Carlsen, who is the world #1 in both classical and blitz, is
famous for his excellent endgame technique. He often outplays his opponents in
equal endgames and generally plays rather quiet chess more often than not. So
I was amazed to find how aggressive his approach is in blitz. I discovered
that he doesn't care much about creating pawn weaknesses in his own camp or
sacrificing material. In these four games I will focus on revealing how and at
what point of the game he starts to dominate - very often to such a degree
that his opponent is distracted from his strategic goals.} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3.
Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. e3 Nbd7 6. Qc2 a5 {What we can see here is a weapon very
often used by Carlsen. Early in the opening he makes a new and rather
challenging move to create a situation in which his opponent doesn't feel
confident. This way he gains a time advantage and avoids any preparation by
his opponents.} 7. a4 {An equally strange answer.} (7. b3 {was the move to

discourage the advance of White's central pawns (f4, e4-e5).} c5 {Black's move
c6-c5 may be antipositional, but the knight on b5 will be far away from the
kingside - the main area of the action.} 15. Ndb5 Be6 $1 {White may have been

f4 are antipositional. Therefore it was easy to guess that Yu Yangyi would

and f4, hoping to achieve e4-e5 in the near future.}) 17... Nh5 $1 {Black

behind White's and Black's moves. Both players were fighting to impose their
will over the opponent, and it was a great fight between two amazingly strong
minds. The Chinese was first to submit to the opponent's will. Nevertheless,
he fought back and, in an amazing finish, generated counterplay in a losing
endgame and even managed to checkmate his mighty opponent.} *

impossible to build the attack the usual way, as there is just no time for
development. Before White develops all his pieces, Black would start his
counterattack on the queenside. So White attempts to take control of the game
by reaching the opponent's king first. Then, after already creating some
strong threats, there may be time for the other pieces to join.} Qa5 16. Qc1 $1

rook? Has Carlsen been using some kind of hypnosis? After analysing those four
games, you should already be aware of the main point: Playing blitz is all
about putting pressure on the opponent. If you can pressure him continuously
by creating threats around his king, he will never be able to relax and focus
on achieving his goals. And don't forget one important thing: In blitz, time
on the clock is no less important than what's objectively happening on the
board. And creating an attack also means gaining time. Attacking is usually
much easier and less risky than defending, and as a result, the player who
exerts pressure and forces his will on his opponent is likely to gain a
significant advantage on the clock. To help you improve your domination skills,
I challenge you to solve the following 15 puzzles.} 1-0

{It is time to reveal two more advanced blitz techniques - bluff and
camouflage. Nowadays Nepo is one of the top classical players, but he is also
a world-class blitz expert, who uses many advanced blitz techniques. In the
following game against Giri, he successfully applies what I call the bluff
technique, which may be described as follows: You create a tense situation in
which you have hidden potential threats. They can be real or not (just looking
dangerous), the opponent will inevitably need to invest time in order to find
out. He may decide to parry them, threat or no threat, but this not only keeps
him from making the best of his position, it also means that you have
successfully forced your will on him (domination). While it is true that a
bluff is often not the objectively best move, even if the opponent looks
through it and finds the best answer, the advantage in time on the clock often
more than compensates for any deficiencies that your bluff may have. A bluff
is a kind of gamble: In a good position, it's more advisable to just win by
making good, forceful moves. Therefore it is mostly employed in difficult or
even desperate situations.} 1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Nf3 a6 5. Be3 Bg7
6. Qd2 b5 7. Bh6 O-O 8. Bd3 {The Pirc Defence is a very difficult opening to
play in blitz, as White's attacking idea is very straightforward. Black has to
play very precisely. If he misses the moment to create counterplay, it can be
too late.} Bb7 $6 {Nepo doesn't feel the subtleties of the line and is soon
forced to play in desperado style.} (8... Nc6 $1 {is the precise continuation.
Black develops his knight and prevents the dangerous advance e4-e5.} 9. e5 dxe5
10. dxe5 Ng4 11. Bxg7 Kxg7 12. Qf4 Ncxe5 13. Nxe5 Qd6 $1 $11) 9. Bxg7 (9. e5
dxe5 10. dxe5 Ng4 11. Bxg7 Kxg7 12. Qf4 {will lead to the same.}) 9... Kxg7 10.
e5 $1 dxe5 {Black's position is already hopeless, as h4-h5 is coming too fast.}
(10... Nd5 11. h4 Nxc3 12. h5 $1 {, and White has a mating attack. In case of}
Rh8 13. h6+ Kg8 14. Qxc3 $18 {, Black has to fight in the sharp middlegame
practically with a rook down.}) 11. dxe5 Ng4 12. Qf4 {Here we can safely say
that White has a winning advantage, as his attack is too strong and Black's
pieces are not prepared for any kind of meaningful counterplay. But it is also
the ideal situation to search for a good bluff. Time is a very limited
resource in blitz, and Nepo will challenge Giri to solve a puzzle on every
move, each of which requires a lot of time to solve. We will see that Giri is
focused on finding an immediate win, rejecting the less favourable options on
his way.} Bxf3 $1 {Nepo offers Giri a material advantage to slow down the
attack and develop some counterplay. While Giri has a choice of various strong
moves, he can only play one of them, and deciding which way to go costs time.
In the game, Giri decides to focus on achieving a decisive material advantage.}
13. Qxf3 {Making a double attack and winning material - who would resist that
opportunity?} (13. gxf3 $5 Nh6 14. O-O-O {On the scale of advantages, 13. gxf3
should be the more clear-cut continuation, as then White would enjoy great
piece domination and a strong attack. Black's chances to survive are close to
zero with such an open king.}) 13... Qd4 $1 {Offering White another choice,
between 14.0-0-0 and taking the rook with 14. Qxa8.} 14. O-O-O ({Giri missed
an immediate win after} 14. Be2 $1 {But this was quite difficult to find. The
rook and the knight are hanging and Rd1 will come next.}) ({The most
attractive looking move was wrong.} 14. Qxa8 $6 Qxf2+ 15. Kd1 Qe3 $1 {This is
the point.} 16. Rf1 Nf2+ 17. Rxf2 Qxf2 {And the position is far from winning
for White.}) 14... Nc6 $1 {The critical moment of the game. The pressure is on
White's side, which is the greatest advantage for the one who makes the bluff.}
15. Be4 $1 {The best move, which you can find by applying the elimination
method, as both} (15. Qxc6 Nxf2 {and}) (15. Ne2 Qa4 16. Qxc6 Nxf2 {are not
immediately winning.}) 15... Ngxe5 16. Rxd4 Nxf3 {And here Giri had to pass
the last obstacle. I suppose that he was already short on time and under a lot
of pressure while trying to find a clear shot. Let's make this a small test:
What would you play here? Can you find the winning idea? In the game, Giri
played} 17. Rdd1 Nfd4 18. Nd5 e6 {, and Black not only left his troubles
behind, but later even went on to win. Try to find what Giri had missed on
move 17. At this point, I would like to tell a famous Bulgarian joke about how
a Bulgarian guy became rich. When he left Bulgaria to look for happiness in
the west, he owned nothing but the jacket on his back. But he had been told
that the English lords love to play poker, so one night he went to the casino
to learn the rules. After the four gentlemen put a lot of money on the table,
the time came to show their hands. One of them said: "I have two pairs", the
second said: "you lose, I have a triplet." The next one said: "I have a full
house", but the last one said: "I have a straight flush", and confidently took
all the money. But the Bulgarian guy saw one important detail: Nobody revealed
their cards, as they completely trusted each other, and their honour is the
most important thing among British gentlemen. So he decided that there was a
great future for him, and after some time he managed to enter the noble
society. Soon he became very rich, which he explained only by his amazing luck.
You can see the idea which made Nepo rich: Black won because he was never
forced to show his hand. He bluffed with moves like Bxf3, Qd4, Nc6, and in the
end, it was enough to win. Now you can try your skills at creating and
revealing bluffs by solving the exercises from the test. But don't forget that
you are practising your blitz skills, so set yourself limited time. To speed
up your calculation, you can use your intuition and the method of elimination.
Enjoy the exercises! I believe that they will teach you one of the most
advanced techniques in blitz, which might help you to significantly improve
your results.} *

{Now I will focus on the camouflage technique. It is very difficult to acquire,
but also very useful, as it pays off well in blitz. To master the camouflage,
you should learn to apply the following simple idea. Imagine a situation in
which you have a couple of good-looking and practically equivalent
alternatives. If possible, quickly choose the move which looks like you are
doing nothing special, but sets some kind of hidden trap. Let's take a look at
a recent game between Carlsen and Mamedyarov. At the critical point of the
game, after 10. Qf3, Mamedyarov could have created immediate counterplay in
the centre by 10..Qc7, but instead he prefered to apply the camouflage move 10.
.Rc8.} 1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. e3 e6 4. Nf3 Bd6 {This time Carlsen takes a
different choice than in game 3, and again different from the classical Bg3 -
the typical technique of posing different problems every time. The difference
may look very small, but the opponent has to think and compare the
consequences of every line.} 5. Nbd2 O-O 6. c3 b6 7. Ne5 c5 8. Bd3 Bb7 9. h4 {
The most aggressive approach. Carlsen is ready to show the main attacking
ideas of the London system.} (9. Qf3 $1 {, to avoid Ne4, may be even stronger.}
) 9... Nc6 (9... Ne4 $5) 10. Qf3 {White's pieces are slowly approaching the
opponent's king, and it is White's primary intention to deliver checkmate.
What should Black do in such a situation? How to meet this kind of obvious
domination attempt?} Rc8 $5 {With this move, Mamedyarov signals courage and
disrespect for what Carlsen is doing, seemingly not caring about his kingside.
But he is doing much more than that. Of course, an aggressive player like him
would not just sit and watch while his opponent is advancing the kingside
pawns. With Rc8, Mamedyarov is applying what I call the camouflage technique.
It can be described in the following way: To make a useful and logical move,
often just a small improvement of your position, waiting for the opponent to
continue with his most natural move as well. In this case, Mamedyarov is
waiting for g2-g4, which is White's most natural way to develop pressure on
the kingside. When your opponent makes the desired move, the camouflage can be
disclosed - usually by means of a hidden trick, punishing the opponent for
what turns out to be a mistake. In this position, there was a more direct way
to escape domination by immediate counterplay in the centre after} (10... Qc7

, Black has} e5 $1 $132) 11. h5 $1 {Seeing through the camouflage! Usually in
this kind of position, White instantly goes for g4-g5, but Carlsen knows that
his opponent is an extremely tricky player and would never play a passive move
like Rc8 without having something in mind. Carlsen has huge experience with
players like Mamedyarov, Nakamura and Nepo, and he smelled that something was
wrong here. Intuitively, he decided that it just can't be good to open the
diagonal against the Bb7. Still, Mamdyarov continues with his camouflage play.}

the next topic of this article, the counterattack. The feeling for the precise
moment to start a counterattack is one of the most important skills in blitz.
If you miss the moment, it may be too late, as we saw in the game
Carlsen-Mamedyarov from the camouflage section. I would like to focus your
attention on the following game and will try to emphasise on how to choose the
correct moment to counterattack. After the moves} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5
{, Mamedyarov has already shown many times his preference for the sharp and
relatively rare continuation} 4. Bg5 {Anand accepts the challenge, and after}
dxc4 $1 5. Nc3 {he plays the theoretically best} a6 6. a4 $5 {This is a new
move. It looks quite suspicious, as after the standard} ({In case of} 6. e4 b5
7. e5 h6 8. Bh4 g5 9. Nxg5 hxg5 10. Bxg5 Nbd7 {, Black achieves a favourable
version of the Botvinnik System.} 11. exf6 Bb7 {The bishop on b7 will become
the most dangerous piece on the board.}) 6... Nc6 $1 7. e4 Na5 {White has
trouble winning back the c4-pawn, which puts his entire concept in question.}
8. Qc2 Be7 9. Rd1 {White is doing his best to create counterchances. Most
probably, Mamedyarov doesn't have any intentions to develop his kingside and
instead is waiting for Black to castle.} h6 $1 {Anand plays the most precise
move, forcing White to decide on which diagonal his bishop will be placed and
avoiding the dangerous lines after} (9... O-O $6 10. h4 {, when White would
have a strong initiative on the kingside. The threat is to take on f6,
followed by e4-e5 and Ng5.}) 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. e5 $1 Be7 12. d5 {We arrive at
the first important moment of the game. It looks like Black is in grave danger
of being smashed by the central pawns, as taking on d5 loses after Rd5. Black
has to find a way to hold off White's early aggression.} O-O $1 {Of course -
Black is not afraid of losing a pawn. White has not enough resources to
continue the attack, as he needs at least three moves to complete development.
Therefore his attack appears to be rather unprepared and Black takes over the
initiative} 13. dxe6 Qe8 $1 14. exf7+ Qxf7 15. Nd5 {Mamedyarov has no choice
but to continue in the same aggressive fashion. But he just doesn't have
enough bullets for a long fight.} b5 $1 16. Be2 Be6 (16... Bb7 $1 17. Nxe7+

very gloomy situation, as there is no way to stop the pawns.} (24... bxa4 25.

{At the end of my article, I would like to turn your attention to the opening
preparation, which is an important element for success in blitz. You need to
prepare a couple of early alternatives aiming to put your opponents at bay at
the start of the game. This will help you a lot to gain confidence and at the
same time will cut off the opponent's opening preparation. I prepared some
ideas that you can use in your games, followed by small tests: Can you find
the novelty? I know that many are struggling to find an antidote to the
Hippopotamus system. It is quite annoying to see your opponent play his first
15 moves quickly and independently of what you are doing. Soon you will find
yourself in a situation where you exceeded your useful moves and need to do
something concrete. So you inevitably stop for a while to work out a plan,
reach a good position, but lose on time. To avoid this kind of scenario, take
a look at the following game.} 1. e4 g6 2. d4 d6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. Be2 {White
plays classical chess while Black is still pretending to play a Pirc Defence.
Playing against Nakamura, you can expect that he will not stick to the usual
development pattern of Nf6, 0-0, c6, Nbd7, which leaves you with a risk-free
minimal advantage in a quiet position. Predictably, Nakamura goes for a Hippo.}
