previously black is intending to play Ba5-c7, reading for e5-e4. Now, the move Ba5-c7 is stopped because of the move Nb5 (the queen can x-tray the c7 bishop and make use of the pin on c6 pawn). } (12. d5!? { After the move Nb6, white gains bishop pair.

1. Bd4! { ** This move is a strong prophylactic move. This prevents black's important plan.
Previously, black wants to develop the f8 bishop to e7 and quickly castles short. Now, the bishop on d4 is attacking the square on g7. Black hence cannot play Bf8-e7. He has to weaken his own position using the move f7-f6, allowing white to play g4 to exploit that extra weakness. } 1... f6 2. g4 *

1. Qa7!? { ** This is a STRONG prophylactic move.
This is a strong move because it stops black's multiple plans. Black wants to finish his development with b6-Bb7 or Ne5-Nc6. However, with this move, all black's chances to get his pieces developed are prevented.
